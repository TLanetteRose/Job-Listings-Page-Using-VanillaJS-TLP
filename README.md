# JobListingsPageUsingVanillaJSTLP
Frontend Mentor Challenge 

![Design Preview for Job Listings with Filtering from Frontend Mentor](./design/desktop-preview.jpg) 

## Background
My goal was to complete this project using Vanilla JavaScript. It has been a challenge for me to learn javascript during my coding journey. The main focus of this project is to pull the job information from a separate file (data.json) and dynamically load the information into the webpage. The job listings then needed to be filtered based on given guidelines. 

The users will be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Filter job listings based on the categories. 


## Completed Design

## Attribution
I referred to a tutorial on Youtube by [Kethmar Salumets](https://youtu.be/j-FUcINCUdM). I needed more guidance in organizing my JavaScript code. This video was very helpful.
